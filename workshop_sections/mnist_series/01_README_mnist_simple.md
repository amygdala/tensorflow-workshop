# Run a simple linear classification version of MNIST

In this section we'll run and take a look at a linear classification version of the 'MNIST' task.
It's a good illustration of a common pattern for creating and training a model in TensorFlow, and we'll walk through the code for it.

## Running the example as a script

The python script for this section is here: [`mnist_simple.py`](./mnist_simple.py).
Run it as follows.  Make sure you're in your python virtual environment (unless you're running in a Docker container):

```sh
$ python mnist_simple.py
```

## Running the example in a Jupyter notebook

You can also run the example as a Jupyter (ipython) notebook.
Start up the Jupyter server from this directory like this:

```sh
$ jupyter notebook
```

When the server starts up, it may bring up a tab automatically in your browser. If not, visit
`http://localhost:8888/`.  Then select `mnist_simple.ipynb`.
