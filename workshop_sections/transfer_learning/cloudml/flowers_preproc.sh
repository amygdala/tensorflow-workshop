# This sample assumes you're already setup for using CloudML.  If this is your
# first time with the service, start here:
# https://cloud.google.com/ml/docs/how-tos/getting-set-up

# Now that we are set up, we can start processing some images. We'll show how
# easy it is to swap in another set of images, instead of using the original
# 'flowers' set.
# For this script, we'll use a fun set of images labeled 'hugs' or 'not-hugs',
# with the images classified as to whether you would want to 'hug' the thing
# shown.

# Usage: hugs_preproc.sh gs://your-bucket-name
# substituting 'your-bucket-name' with the name of the GCS bucket to use.

# gs://aju-vtests2-ml-amy

# We'll use Dataflow (Beam) to do our preprocessing. The preprocessing will use
# the trained Inception 3 model, and run our images through it to derive so-
# called 'bottleneck' embeddings for the images. The embedding info will be
# saved in the form of TFRecords, in GCS. We'll be able to use these records to
# train our own model.

# It takes a bit of time to preprocess all the images. For the workshop, we will
# also have pre-generated records that you can point to during the training
# phase.


# These calls are synchronous just for shell scripting ease. You could use
# --runner DataflowPipelineRunner to run them asynchronously.
# The following uses just 3 cores each, but you can edit to use more
# if your project quota is sufficient to do so.
