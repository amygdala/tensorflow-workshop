# Classifying your own images using *transfer learning*

The [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) is great for identifying labels, or categories, for a given
image. However, sometimes you want to further classify your own images, in more specialized categories that the Google
Vision API hasn't been trained on.

This lab shows how we can use an existing NN model to do this, via *transfer learning* -- effectively bootstrapping an
existing model to reduce the effort needed to learn something new.

Specifically, we will take an 'Inception v3' architecture model trained to classify images against 1000 different 'ImageNet' categories, and using its penultimate "bottleneck" layer, train a new top layer that can recognize other
classes of images: your own classes.

We'll see that our new top layer does not need to be very complex, and that we typically don't need much data or much
training of this new model, to get good results for our new image classifications.

In addition to the transfer learning, this example shows off several other interesting aspects of TensorFlow and Cloud
ML. It shows how to use
[Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) ([Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/))
to do image preprocessing -- the Beam pipeline uses Inception v3 to generate the inputs to the new 'top layer' that we will train -- and how to save those preprocessing results in [TFRecords](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/python_io/) for consumption by the training loop.

The example also includes a little "prediction web server" that shows how you can
**use the Cloud ML API for prediction** once your trained model is serving.

(This example is based on the example
[here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/master/flowers), but with a number of additional modifications).

## The "hugs/not-hugs" image classification task

Just for fun, we'll show how we can train our NN to decide whether images are of 'huggable' or 'not huggable' things.

So, we'll use a training set of images that have been sorted into two categories -- whether or not one would want to hug the object in the photo.
(Thanks to Julia Ferraioli for this dataset).

The 'hugs' does not have a large number of images, but as we will see, prediction on new images still works surprisingly well.  This shows the power of 'bootstrapping' the pre-trained Inception model.

(This directory also includes some scripts support training on a larger 'flowers classification' dataset too.)

### 1. Image Preprocessing

We start with a set of labeled images in a Google Cloud Storage bucket, and preprocess them to extract the image
features from the "bottleneck" layer -- essentially, the penultimate layer -- of the Inception network. To do this, we
load the saved Inception model and its variable values into TensorFlow, and run each image through that model. (This
model has been open-sourced by Google).

More specifically, we process each image to produce its feature representation (also known as an *embedding*) in the
form of a k-dimensional vector of floats (in our case, 2,048 dimensions). The preprocessing includes converting the
image format, resizing images, and running the converted image through a pre-trained model to get the embeddings.

The reason this approach is so effective for bootstrapping new image classification is that these 'bottleneck'
embeddings contain a lot of high-level feature information useful to Inception for its own image classification.

Although processing images in this manner can be reasonably expensive, each image can be processed independently and in
parallel, making this task a great candidate for Cloud Dataflow.

#### 1.1 Deploy the preprocessing job to Cloud Dataflow

We need to run preprocessing for both our training and evaluation images.  We've defined a script, `hugs_preproc.sh`,
to do this.

First, set the `BUCKET` variable to point to your GCS bucket (replacing `your-bucket-name` with the actual name):

```shell
BUCKET=gs://your-bucket-name
```

Then, run the pre-processing script. The script is already set up with links to the 'hugs' image data. The script
will launch two non-blocking Cloud Dataflow jobs to do the preprocessing for the eval and training datasets. By
default it only uses 3 workers for each job, but you can change this if you have larger quota.

```shell
./hugs_preproc.sh $BUCKET
```

If running in a docker container, instead run the script as follows, setting the `USER` environment var to some value:

```shell
USER=xxx ./hugs_preproc.sh $BUCKET
```

This script will generate a timestamp-based `GCS_PATH`, that it will display in STDOUT.
The pipelines will write the generated embeds into
[TFRecords files containing tf.train.Example protocol buffers](https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/reading_data/), under `$GCS_PATH/preproc`.

You can see your pipeline jobs running in the 
Dataflow panel of the [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow).
Before you use these generated embeds, you'll want to make sure that the Dataflow jobs have finished.


### 2. Modeling: Training the classifier

Once we've preprocessed our data, and have the generated image embeds, 
we can then train a simple classifier. The network will comprise a single fully-
connected layer with *RELU* activations and with one output for each label in the dictionary to replace the original
output layer.
The final output is computed using the [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) function. In the
training stages, we're using the [*dropout*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropout_(neural_networks)) technique, which
randomly ignores a subset of input weights to prevent over-fitting to the training dataset.

### 2.1 For the workshop, use pre-generated TFRecords for training

Because we have limited workshop time, we've saved a set of generated TFRecords for the "hugs" images that you can
copy to your own bucket, so that you don't need to wait for Dataflow jobs to finish. If you didn't already copy this
data as part of the [installation instructions](/INSTALL.md#set-up-some-data-files-used-in-the-examples), you can do it now.

Copy a zip of the generated records to a directory on your local machine:

```shell
gsutil cp gs://oscon-tf-workshop-materials/transfer_learning/cloudml/hugs_preproc_tfrecords.zip .
```

and then expand the zip:

```shell
unzip hugs_preproc_tfrecords.zip
```

Set the `GCS_PATH` variable to point to a new directory under your own bucket, and copy the unzipped records to a `preproc` directory under that path:

```shell
GCS_PATH=$BUCKET/hugs_preproc_tfrecords
gsutil cp -r hugs_preproc_tfrecords/ $GCS_PATH/preproc
```

Once you've done that you can delete the local zip and `hugs_preproc_tfrecords` directory.

(As indicated above, with more time, you could wait for your Dataflow preprocessing jobs to finish running, then point to your own generated image embeds instead).

### 2.2 Run the training script

Now, using the value of `GCS_PATH` that you set above, run your training job in the cloud:

```shell
./hugs_train.sh $BUCKET $GCS_PATH
```

This script will output summary and model checkpoint information under `$GCS_PATH/training`.

### 2.3 Monitor the training

As the training runs, you should see the logs stream to STDOUT.  You can also view them with:

```shell
gcloud beta ml jobs stream-logs "$JOB_ID"
```

[** how to see in cloud console **]

We can also monitor the progress of the training using [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/).  

To do this, start up Tensorboard in a new shell (don't forget to activate your virtual environment), pointing it to the training logs in GCS:

```shell
tensorboard --logdir=$GCS_PATH/training
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:6006`.


### 3. Prediction: Using the trained model

For prediction, we don't want to separate the image preprocessing and inference into two separate steps, because we need to perform both in sequence for every image. Instead, we create a single TensorFlow graph that produces the image embedding and does the classification using the trained model in one step.

After training, the saved model information will be in `$GCS_PATH/training/model`.

Our next step is to tell Cloud ML that we want to use and serve that model.
We do that via the following script, where `v1` is our model version name, and `hugs` is our model name.


```shell
./model.sh $GCS_PATH v1 hugs
```

The model is created first.  This only needs to happen once, and is done as follows:
`gcloud beta ml models create <model_name>`

Then, we create a 'version' of that model, based on the data in our model directory (`$GCS_PATH/training/model`), and set that version as the default.

You can see what models and default versions we have in your project via:

```shell
gcloud beta ml models list
```

It will take a minute or so for the model version to start "serving".  Once our model is serving, we make prediction requests to it -- both from the command line and via the Cloud ML API.


#### 3.1 Prediction from the command line using gcloud

To make a prediction request from the command line, we need to encode the image(s) we want to send it into a json format.  See the `images_to_json.py` script for the details.  This command:

```
python images_to_json.py -o request.json <image1> <image2> ...
```

results in a `request.json` file with the encoded image info. Then, run this command:

```shell
gcloud beta ml predict --model $MODEL_NAME --json-instances request.json
```

You should see a result something along the lines of the following:

```shell
gcloud beta ml predict --model hugs --json-instances request.json 
KEY                             PREDICTION  SCORES
prediction_images/hedgehog.jpg  1           [4.091006485396065e-05, 0.9999591112136841, 1.8843516969013763e-08]
```

The prediction index (e.g. '1') corresponds to the label at that index in the 'label dict' used to construct the example set during preprocessing,
and the score for each index is listed under SCORES. (The last element in the scores list is used for any example images that did not have an associated label).

The 'hugs' dataset label dict is here:

```shell
gsutil cat gs://oscon-tf-workshop-materials/transfer_learning/cloudml/hugs_photos/dict.txt
```

So, that means that index 0 is the 'hugs' label, and index 1 is 'not-hugs'.  Therefore, the prediction above indicates that the hedgehog is 'not-hugs', with score 0.9999591112136841.

#### 3.2 Prediction using the Cloud ML API: A prediction web server

We can also request predictions via the Cloud ML API, and the google api client libraries.
We've included a little example web server that shows how to do this, and also makes it easy to see how a given image gets labeled.

The web app lets you upload an image, and then it generates a json request containing the image, and sends that to the Cloud ML API.  In response, we get back prediction and score information, and display that on a result page.

Run the web server according to the instructions in its [README](web_server).

## Appendix: Running training locally

If you want to run the training session locally (this can be useful for debugging), you will need to point the
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to a local service account credentials file like this:

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials/file.json
```

Then initiate the local training like this, defining a local output path to use:

```shell
gcloud beta ml local train --package-path trainer/ --module-name trainer.task \
    -- \
    --max-steps 1000 \
    --train_data_paths "$GCS_PATH/preproc/train*" \
    --eval_data_paths "$GCS_PATH/preproc/eval*" \
    --eval_set_size 19 \
    --output_path output/
```
