This directory contains the workshop labs.

- [Building a small starter TensorFlow graph](starter_tf_graph/README.md)
- [XOR: A minimal training example](xor/README.md)
- [Introducing MNIST, and building a simple linear classifier in TensorFlow](mnist_series/01_README_mnist_simple.md).
- [Using TensorFlow's high-level APIs to build an MNIST DNN Classifier, and introducing TensorBoard](mnist_series/02_README_mnist_tflearn.md).
- [Building the same classifier using TensorFlow's "low-level" APIs](mnist_series/the_hard_way).
- [Building custom `Estimator`s for a version of MNIST that uses CNNs](mnist_series/mnist_cnn/README.md).
- [Running distributed MNIST using Cloud ML](mnist_series/cloudml).
- [Transfer learning: using a trained model to 'bootstrap' learning new classifications](transfer_learning/README.md).
    + [Using Cloud ML](transfer_learning/cloudml)
    + [Using a custom Estimator](transfer_learning/TF_Estimator)
- [Building a word2vec model using a Custom Estimator, and exploring the learned embeddings](word2vec/README.md). Introducing [TFRecords](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/python_io.html#data-io-python-functions).

In addition, there is an [extras](extras/README.md) directory, that contains some older labs not currently used in this workshop, but which may be of interest.
