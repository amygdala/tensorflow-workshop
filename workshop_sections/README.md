# TensorFlow workshop lab sections

This directory contains the workshop labs.

- [Building a small starter TensorFlow graph](starter_tf_graph/README.md)
- [Introducing MNIST, and building a simple linear classifier in TensorFlow](mnist_series/01_README_mnist_simple.md).
- [Using TensorFlow's high-level APIs to build an MNIST DNN Classifier, and introducing TensorBoard](mnist_series/02_README_mnist_tflearn.md).
- [Using TensorFlow's "low-level" APIs to build an MNIST DNN Classifier. Saving and loading model checkpoints, and generating TensorBoard summaries](mnist_series/03_README_mnist_layers.md).
- [Building a word2vec model using a Custom Estimator, and exploring the learned embeddings](word2vec/README.md). Introducing TFRecords. Explore how TensorFlow's high-level APIs makes it easy to run distributed training on Cloud ML.

In addition, there is an [extras](extras/README.md) directory, that contains some older labs not currently used in this workshop, but which may be of interest.
